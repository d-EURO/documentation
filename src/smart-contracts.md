# Smart Contracts

**A technical overview of all smart contracts powering the JuiceDollar protocol.**

The JuiceDollar protocol consists of multiple smart contracts that work together to create a trustless, oracle-free stablecoin system. All contracts are deployed on Citrea (Bitcoin L2) and are fully immutable - no admin keys, no upgrades, no central control.

## Contract Architecture

<figure style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/contract-architecture.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Smart Contract Architecture</p></figcaption></figure>

The contracts are organized into five main categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Core** | Token contracts and reserve management |
| **MintingHub** | Position management and collateralized minting |
| **Savings** | Interest-bearing savings functionality |
| **Bridges** | Stablecoin conversion |
| **Gateways** | Frontend rewards and enhanced functionality |

---

## Core Contracts

### JuiceDollar (JUSD)

The main stablecoin token contract - an ERC-20 token designed to track the value of the US Dollar.

**Key Features:**
- Implements ERC-20, ERC-2612 (Permit), and ERC-3009 (Transfer with Authorization)
- Open to arbitrary minting plugins with veto-based governance
- Creates the Equity contract during deployment
- Manages the minter registry and position registry
- Handles reserve accounting and loss coverage

**Key Functions:**
- `suggestMinter()` - Propose a new minting contract (requires fee and application period)
- `denyMinter()` - Qualified shareholders can veto minting proposals
- `mintWithReserve()` - Mint JUSD with reserve contribution (minters only)
- `burnFromWithReserve()` - Burn JUSD and reclaim proportional reserve

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Symbol** | JUSD |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Min Application Period** | 14 days |
| **Min Application Fee** | 1,000 JUSD |

| Network | Address |
|---------|---------|
| **Mainnet** | [`0x0987D3720D38847ac6dBB9D025B9dE892a3CA35C`](https://citreascan.com/address/0x0987D3720D38847ac6dBB9D025B9dE892a3CA35C) |

---

### Equity (JUICE)

The equity token representing shares in the JuiceDollar reserve pool. Holding JUICE is similar to being a shareholder of a bank.

**Key Features:**
- ERC-20 token with time-weighted voting power

- Votes accumulate over time: `votes = balance * holdingDuration`
- Longer holding = more voting power
- Delegation adds to delegate's power without removing own votes
