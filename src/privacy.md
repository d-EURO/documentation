# Privacy Policy

Dear Sir or Madam,  

The dEURO Association takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We attach great importance to data protection.  

The confidential and responsible handling of personal data from our relationships with customers, business partners, employees, applicants, and suppliers is the foundation of our mission. Personal data refers to all information relating to an identified or identifiable person.  
We therefore adhere to the following principles when handling personal data:  
- Confidentiality and transparency

- Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  

In case of discrepancies, the English version of this policy will prevail unless otherwise required by applicable law.

## 2. General Information on Data Protection

The dEURO Association treats your personal data confidentially and in accordance with applicable data protection regulations and this privacy policy. We process personal data of contractual partners in direct connection with the conclusion or execution of a contract (justification).  

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. However, if a data subject wishes to make use of specific services via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If the processing of personal data is required and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will obtain the consent of the data subject in a suitable form after providing appropriate information.  

We would like to point out that, despite the security precautions we have taken, data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) may be subject to security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.  

As the individual concerned, it is in your personal interest to protect the system(s) you use (PC, laptop, etc.) from unauthorized access by third parties, to provide adequate password protection, and not to disclose the password to others. It is recommended that you install a commercially available virus protection program and update it regularly.

### What do we use your data for?

Some of the data is collected to ensure that the website and dEURO Association services are provided without errors. In principle, no additional data is collected to analyze user behavior.  

### What rights do you have regarding your data?

You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data free of charge at any time. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.  

You can contact our support team at info@deuro.com at any time with regard to this and other questions on the subject of data protection.

## 4. General Notes and Mandatory Information

### Storage Period

Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under applicable tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will occur once these reasons no longer apply.

### General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website

The website only stores and processes the minimum data required to operate the website. No additional data is stored or collected.  

### Note on the Transfer of Data Abroad

We use the hosting service All-Inkl, a company from Germany. When these tools are accessed, your personal data may be transferred to this third country and could be processed there.

### SSL or TLS Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as inquiries you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Rights of Data Subjects

As a user whose personal data is processed under this Privacy Policy, you have the following rights:  
- Right to information about whether and in what form the dEURO Association stores personal data (e.g., categories of data, recipients or categories of recipients, retention periods, or criteria for retention).  
- Right to rectification or correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.  
- Right to erasure of personal data, provided that the legal requirements are met.  
- Right to restriction of the processing of personal data, provided that the legal requirements are met.  
- Right to object to the processing of your personal data, in particular for marketing purposes.  
- Right to data portability: You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.  

The above rights may be denied or restricted if the interests, rights, and freedoms of third parties prevail or if the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

### Objection to Advertising Emails

We hereby object to the use of contact data published as part of our obligation to provide a legal notice for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information material. The operators of the website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.

## 5. Data Collection on This Website

### Cookies

The dEURO Association uses cookies exclusively to maintain the operation of the IT systems and their functionality. No cookies are used for tracking user behavior or similar purposes.

### Inquiry by Email, Telephone, or Fax

If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, we will store and process your inquiry, including all personal data (name, inquiry), for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass on this data without your consent.  

The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions—in particular statutory retention periods—remain unaffected.

## 6. Analysis Tools and Advertising

The dEURO Association does not use website analysis tools such as Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, or others.

## 7. Newsletter and Social Media

### Newsletter Data

If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require a valid email address from you, as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the email address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter (so-called confirmation email in the "double opt-in procedure"). No further data is collected. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.

### Our Social Media Presence

#### Data Processing by Social Media Networks

We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social media networks. The individual social media networks we use are listed below.  

Social media networks such as LinkedIn, Instagram, etc., can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or advertising banners). Visiting our social media presences triggers numerous data protection-relevant processing operations.  

If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. However, your personal data may also be collected if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data collection takes place, for example, via cookies that are stored on your end device or by recording your IP address.  

With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, interest-based advertising can be displayed to you within and outside the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social media network, the interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or have been logged in.  

Please also note that we cannot track all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, further processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. For details, please refer to the terms of use and data protection provisions of the respective social media portals.

#### Storage Period

The data collected directly by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions—in particular retention periods—remain unaffected.  

We have no influence on the storage period of your data that is stored by the operators of social media networks for their own purposes. For details, please contact the operators of the social media networks directly (e.g., in their privacy policies and statements, see below).

## 8. Data Protection for Applications and in the Application Process

The controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of carrying out the application process. This processing may also take place electronically, in particular if applicants send relevant application documents by email (e.g., in PDF format or other file types).  

If you apply for a job advertised by us, these data protection provisions apply in addition to our other data protection provisions, which have been communicated to you separately or are available on our website.  

The application is made exclusively via LinkedIn. If you apply for a vacancy via LinkedIn, please note that LinkedIn may store your personal data and may collect further data in relation to the progress of your application. Any use of your data by LinkedIn will be in accordance with LinkedIn’s privacy policy. LinkedIn undertakes to maintain high standards of data protection and data security.  

If the person responsible for processing concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the data transmitted will be stored at the dEURO Association for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with statutory provisions and to ensure protection from unauthorized access.  

If no employment contract is concluded, the application documents will be deleted automatically and without further notification 12 months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the data processing controller prevent deletion. Legitimate interests can include, for example, obligations to provide evidence in legal proceedings.
